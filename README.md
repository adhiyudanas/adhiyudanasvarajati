## Overall Concept
This page is developed using vue.js cli and deployed on github.
I tried to make a simple profile page and challenged myself to develop my own page. 
Through this small project, I attempted to learn and demonstrate:
- Construct webpage using JS framework from the beginning stage
- Manage assets efficiently
- Manage directory and project structure effectively
- Learn how to manage your own small project, manage time and tasks
- Learn how to host pages, deploy, and manage version control
- Manage css using preprocessor (SCSS)
- Using typescript in my page development
- Incorporate responsive design to accommodate multiple devices

## Design
It was quite a challenging tasks to design your own page, what kind of contents are you putting in, and what impact you want the page to have to your viewer.
I tried to collect as much inspirations from various sources as possible, and try to adapt certain concepts that fit my own idea.

I personally chose my own color palettes, fonts, and emphasize UI/UX principle as much as possible.
I enjoy the challenges, hurdle, and keep on learning to improve my design capability. 

## Future improvement
This is the first version of my profile page, and more to expect in the coming months.
Realizing that there are still so many rooms for improvement keeps me motivated to explore more design choices, and maybe next time I will try to use new technologies, frameworks, plugin, so I can create better works.

Thank You for your time checking out my page, and looking forward to working together with you & your team. Cheers!
